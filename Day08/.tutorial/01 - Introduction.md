# Practice Set Introduction

Welcome to the JavaScript practice set! In this set, we'll explore various JavaScript concepts through practical exercises. JavaScript is a powerful programming language commonly used for web development, and mastering its fundamentals is essential for building interactive web applications.

## Concepts Covered:

> 1. **Logical Operators:** We'll use logical operators such as `&&` and `||` to perform logical operations on variables, helping us make decisions based on certain conditions.
> 
> 2. **Switch Case Statements:** The `switch` statement provides a concise way to evaluate an expression and execute different code blocks based on its value. We'll demonstrate how to use it effectively for conditional branching.
> 
> 3. **Number Divisibility:** We'll learn how to check whether a given number is divisible by another number using the modulo operator `%`, and we'll apply this knowledge to solve problems related to divisibility by specific numbers.
> 
> 4. **Ternary Operator:** The ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`) provides a compact way to write simple conditional statements. We'll utilize it to determine whether a person can drive based on their age.

#### Let's dive in and sharpen our JavaScript skills together!
