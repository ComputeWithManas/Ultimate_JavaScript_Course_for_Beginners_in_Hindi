# The If-Else If-Else Statement
The basic syntax for an `if-else if-else` statement is as follows:
```js
if(condition1){
    //code if condition1 is true
}
else if(condition2){
    //code if condition2 is true
}
else{
    //code if both condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```
The `if-else if-else` statement checks if the condition1 is true or false. If the condition1 is true, the code inside the `if` statement is executed. If the condition1 is false, the code inside the `else if` statement is executed. If both condition1 and condition2 are false, the code inside the `else` statement is executed.
