# Behaviour

 1. The expression in the `switch` statement is evaluated.
 2. The value of the expression is compared with each `case` value.
 3. If a match is found, the corresponding code block is executed, and the `switch` statement is exited unless a `break` statement is encountered.
 4. If no match is found, and a `default` case is provided, the code block within the `default` case is executed.
 5. If no match is found, and no `default` case is provided, the `switch` statement has no effect.
