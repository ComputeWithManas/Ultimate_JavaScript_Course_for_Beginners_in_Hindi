## Q2: Using typeof
Use the typeof keyword to see the data type of the variables in the previous question. 
<!-- Also, note that when you write a + b, you are doing string concatenation, but when you write (a + b), you are doing addition. -->

```javascript
console.log(typeof name); // "string"
console.log(typeof age); // "number"
```
When you use the typeof keyword with a variable, it returns a string indicating the data type of that variable. In this case, name is a string, and age is a number.
