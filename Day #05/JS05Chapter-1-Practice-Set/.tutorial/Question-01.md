## Q1: Adding numbers to strings
Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it. 
<!-- For example, create a variable name with a string value, and a variable age with a number value, and then try to concatenate them using the + operator. Briefly describe the concept of concatenation in your answer. -->

```javascript
let name = "Manas";
let age = 15;
console.log(name + age); // Output: Manas15
```
In JavaScript, **concatenation** is the process of combining two or more strings into a single string. When you use the + operator with a string and a number, the number is automatically converted to a string and then concatenated with the original string. We'll cover more about string concatenation in the future.
